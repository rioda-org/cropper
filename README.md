# Image Multi Crop Tool

This tool will allow you to load an image, mark multiple rectangles on it that you want to crop, and will save them as separate images.

Problem I had was, I scanned like 5 photographs in one go for faster scanning. Ended up with image containing 5 photos that needed to be cropped out.

Photoshop could not detect and split them because I had placed them one next to each other. So not to crop one by one, this tool can save you time.

Install Python, I was working with 3.12.6. Run python script and that's it.
